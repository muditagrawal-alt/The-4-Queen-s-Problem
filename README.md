# 4-Queens Problem Documentation

## Description
This repository contains a Word document explaining the **4-Queens Problem**, a classic computer science and mathematics puzzle. The problem involves placing 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Contents
The document includes:
1. An introduction to the 4-Queens Problem.
2. A detailed explanation of the constraints.
3. A step-by-step guide to solving the problem using backtracking.
4. Applications and relevance of the problem in algorithm design.

## How to Access
1. Download the Word document: 'A Brief Solution to the 4-Queen's Problem.docx'.
2. Open it using Microsoft Word or any compatible word processor.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a detailed explanation of the 4-Queens Problem, including its algorithmic solution and practical applications. It is intended for students and enthusiasts interested in learning about constraint satisfaction problems and backtracking.
